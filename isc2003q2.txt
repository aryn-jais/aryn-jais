Given a time in numbers we can convert it into words.
For example:- 5:00 five o’clock 5:10 ten minutes past five 5:15 quarter past five 5:30 half past five 5:40 twenty minutes to six 5:45 quarter to six 5:47 thirteen minutes to six.
Write a program which first inputs two integers, the first between 1 and 12 (both inclusive) and second between 0 and 59(both inclusive) and then prints out the time they represent, in words.
Your program should follow the format of the example below:-

SAMPLE  DATA :
INPUT :  
TIME  : 3:0 
OUTPUT : 3:00  Three O’clock    
INPUT :  
TIME  : 7:29  
OUTPUT : 7:29  Twenty Nine Minutes Past Seven   
INPUT :    TIME  : 6:34  
OUTPUT : 6:34  Twenty Six  Minutes To Seven     
Test your program for the data values given in the example above and some random data.
